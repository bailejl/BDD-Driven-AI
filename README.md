# BDD-Driven AI

Is setup to try ever complex scenarios to see the limitations of AI. The intent is to try to get AI to create new features with minimal input from the developer. While progressing from a simple proof of concept app to an enterprise-like system. Along the way, the process will evolve and learning shared.

Scenarios are used to test AI and are on their own branch. More details can be found in [scenarios](#scenarios) below.

## Background

This app started a proof of concept for Concise Declarative Gherkin, which was about 5 years old. So, it was updated and technologies replaced to test AI, which it did well. To learn more, read about [the journey.](./docs/the-journey.md)

## Scenarios

Each scenario resides in its own branch. They progress from simplistic using the proof of concept code, progressing to realistic enterprise-like solutions. Read [scenarios](./scenarios/scenarios.md) for more info.

**Recommend**: looking at the branches in the repo to see what scenarios are available.

## Local Development
